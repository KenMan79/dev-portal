## ViewBlock
<img alt="Viewblock" src={useBaseUrl('img/dev/tools/viewblock.png')} />

ViewBlock allows you to look at blocks, address, transactions, status of the Zilliqa network, contract code and variables...

| Network | Link |
| ------- | ---- |
| Mainnet | https://viewblock.io/zilliqa |
| Testnet | https://viewblock.io/zilliqa?network=testnet |

For example, [this](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/tx/c4030c73d6dae558ff0c9d98237101e342888115f13219a00bb14a8ee46fa3be?network=testnet)
is the link to a `getHello()` transition transaction.

If you create a legit token and have a logo, head over to the [cryptometa](https://github.com/Ashlar/cryptometa) repository and follow the Readme instructions.
